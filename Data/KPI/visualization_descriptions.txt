VISUALIZATION DESCRIPTIONS FOR REPORT
=====================================

1. **Passenger Count Over Time (Line Graph)**
   - Shows average passenger count throughout the day with sensor comparison
   - Highlights capacity thresholds and peak usage times
   - Useful for identifying when additional buses are needed

2. **Crowding Levels Heatmap**
   - Displays occupancy patterns across all stops and hours
   - Red boxes indicate critical overcrowding conditions
   - Helps identify problematic stop-time combinations

3. **Alert Frequency Bar Chart**
   - Shows which stops trigger the most overcrowding alerts
   - Includes average line for comparison
   - Guides infrastructure improvement priorities

4. **Bus Status Distribution Pie Chart**
   - Visualizes time spent in each occupancy state
   - Exploded overcrowded segment for emphasis
   - Quantifies overall system performance

5. **Sensor Accuracy Analysis**
   - Compares IR sensor vs camera readings
   - Shows how accuracy varies with occupancy levels
   - Validates sensor fusion approach

6. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Three-panel view of real-time operations
   - Shows passenger count, boarding/alighting, and occupancy
   - Provides detailed operational insights

7. **Stop Performance Dashboard**
   - Four metrics per stop: flow, occupancy, turnover, alerts
   - Comprehensive stop-level analysis
   - Identifies high-demand locations

8. **Peak Hour Analysis**
   - Highlights morning and evening rush hours
   - Shows passenger flow patterns and alert frequency
   - Supports scheduling decisions

9. **KPI Summary Dashboard**
   - Executive-level overview of key metrics
   - Visual KPIs for quick assessment
