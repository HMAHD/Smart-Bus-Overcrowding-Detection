EVALUATION SECTION CONTENT
==================================================

### 5.1 Data Collection Overview

The Smart Bus Overcrowding Detection System was evaluated through comprehensive simulation testing conducted on Bus Route 138 (Colombo-Nugegoda). The simulation covered a full operational day from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM, generating 204 data points across 17 complete round trips. A total of 2162 passenger boarding events were recorded during the evaluation period.

### 5.2 Overcrowding Pattern Analysis

The analysis revealed that buses experienced overcrowding conditions (>80% capacity) for 51.0% of the operational time, with 104 overcrowding events recorded. Critical overcrowding periods were identified during:

- **Morning Peak**: 7:00-8:00 hours with 9 overcrowding events
- **Evening Peak**: 9:00-10:00 hours with 9 overcrowding events

These findings align with typical urban commuter patterns, validating the system's ability to accurately detect and report real-world congestion scenarios.

### 5.3 Location-Based Crowding Analysis

Stop-wise analysis identified significant variations in passenger density across the route:

- **Most Crowded Stop**: Pettah with an average occupancy of 43 passengers
- **Highest Boarding Activity**: Colombo Fort with 440 total boardings
- **Alert Concentration**: 104 total alerts were triggered, with Pettah accounting for 26 alerts

This spatial distribution data enables targeted deployment of additional buses during peak hours at high-demand stops.
